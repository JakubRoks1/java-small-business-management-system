# Java Small Business Management System
assignment was a team project realised as a part of my university degree. As a team we were developing a functional Java back-end system based on the client's needs.

# Client Problem Explanation

*I am the owner of a small business that sells homemade trinkets and household items. I have a store 'Tricky Trinkets' on what used to be a quiet high street in the village. There has been a bunch of development in the village, and thus bringing in more custom. I used to manage with the small number of customers, but now I am starting to struggle to process customer transactions with the increased customer count.

Currently, I run the store single-handed and process customer transactions through a manual checkout till. I have a paper log of the amount of what each customer has purchased, a paper log of the stock in the store, and I write receipts out manually for each transaction. You can start to see why I can't handle the increase in customers.

I'd ideally like a program, or some kind of solution, that does all of that for me. Of course, if you can come up with some extra features that would make my life easier than that'd be great.

Kind Regards, Tricky Trinkets Manager*
